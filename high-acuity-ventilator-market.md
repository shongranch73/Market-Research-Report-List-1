<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Acuity Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high acuity ventilator market is segmented into two main types: non-invasive and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators deliver airflow through masks or nasal prongs, providing respiratory support without the need for intubation, making them suitable for moderate respiratory distress. In contrast, invasive ventilators require intubation, directly connecting to the patient’s airway, and are used in severe cases, offering more controlled ventilation. Both types are essential in critical care settings, catering to varying levels of respiratory support needs.</p></p>
